* State

The package stores its state in several variables ([[file:kubernetes.el::;;%20Main%20state][here]]), which are set by background
polling timers ([[file:kubernetes.el::;;%20Background%20polling%20processes][here]]). These variables are cleared whenever:

1. The user closes the display-pods buffer, or
2. The user switches their Kubernetes context.

Certain operations can update these state variables, such as attempting to read
a list of pods or contexts from the user before the timers have completed, or
updating the current namespace, which invalidates most cache variables but
retains the current context.

* Rendering

Rendering the main pods list is divided into two stages:

1. Take the current state and compile an AST of the desired changes
2. Erase the buffer and interpret the AST to execute the changes ([[file:kubernetes.el::;;%20Render%20AST%20Interpreter][here]]).

The AST is represented as a list with the following simple grammar:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
hiddenp = t | nil

ast = ( line . STRING )
    | ( heading . STRING )
    | ( section ( SYMBOL hiddenp ) ast )
    | ( padding )
    | ( ast* )
#+END_EXAMPLE
